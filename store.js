      title: `Endless Traffic Gridlock`,
      body: `Every day drivers and users of transit in Miami-Dade experience anger and frustration from the battle they face to get to work or other obligations of daily life. We were promised transit and we don’t have it. We voted for a half-penny tax to expand transit options 20 years ago, the county has failed to deliver. Poor planning, failed leadership, and subverting the dedicated funding for transit expansion to cover daily transportation operations has left all of us as prisoners in our own cars. 

      I am committed to fighting for true transit expansion that would provide relief for all of District 7. During my term as Mayor of Pinecrest, I joined with other South Dade mayors, legislators and commissioners demanding the expansion of the Metrorail from Dadeland to Homestead, but our demands have still not been met. I am committed to continue that fight until it is realized. A true one ticket Metrorail ride would alleviate much of the traffic gridlock along US 1. Likewise, the Kendall community has not had any transit options even considered for the past two decades. County planning must incorporate and provide real transit and mobility options for Kendall.`

      title: `Flooding and Rising Seas`,
      body: `Because our county and the entire eastern border of District 7 is on the coast, we are particularly vulnerable to the effects from rising seas. Whether we are talking about flooding and other damage from the increasingly extreme weather patterns, these problems must be tackled through meaningful investments in infrastructure. 

      ​
      
      For the past decade I have focused on addressing these issues at the municipal, county, and regional level. We must collaborate with businesses and community members to plan for and invest in adaptive measures to protect our homes, businesses, schools and families from this growing threat. As your county commissioner, I will continue to make this a priority and will bring the stakeholders together to address these issues.`

      title: `Water Contamination`,
      body: `Our sewer lines are degrading and leaking into ground water that runs into Biscayne Bay. This is one of our most pressing and immediate needs. We must maintain and expand our county water and sewer systems. Thousands of homeowners in District 7 have no access to the county potable water or sewer system. The current failure to address this lack of basic infrastructure puts our residents at risk of a public health crisis. Additionally, the looming impact of sea level rise and the resulting salt water intrusion continues to threaten the well water that many residents must rely on. Likewise, the rising water table is causing septic tanks to fail, compounding the need for expanded county sewer systems. The contamination of Biscayne Bay threatens our aquifer, our source of drinking water and our access to clean water for our families’ recreation, as well as our tourism industry. I am attending Biscayne Bay Task Force meetings regularly, and have spoken out with a sense of urgency to immediately invest in and repair our failing water and sewer infrastructure.`

      title: `Community Leadership`,
      body: `District 7 includes 5 cities and sections of unincorporated Miami-Dade County. To best address the additional infrastructure problems facing families and businesses in the district, the city and county governments must work together. We have roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure on which we all rely that need to be addressed. We must clean up and remediate the contamination in many of our county parks within the district that have been closed or abandoned. We have been deprived of the natural and recreational public resources due to neglect by the county and the diversion of tax dollars. To address these concerns, we must have bold leadership and collaboration between the cities and county. I have a proven track record of working with municipal, business and community leaders within the district and will do so as the County Commissioner for District 7.`
